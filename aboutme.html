            <p> My name is Nicol Troyan; I teach mathematics and physics and create workbooks, training courses, games
                and quests. I am, first of all, a person who passionately loves to learn, children and teach. In my
                ideal world, children do not get an education. They keep exploring forever. They do not stop asking many
                questions, continue questioning the most diverse beliefs, and do not concentrate on polar points
                dividing the world into black and white. I dream that children look at the world curiously and enjoy
                studying it. In my lessons, I cultivate clear and straightforward communication of thought, and "silly"
                questions and doubts become a natural part of the lesson.

            <p>
                I am originally from Latvia and moved to the UK at the age of 15; I know firsthand the difficulties of
                adapting to a new environment. Partially this is why in 2022, I decided to retrain â€” 7 years of working
                with children made me understand that the attachment between me and the students can be therapeutic and
                is the real value in their lives and mine.
                Now it is easier for me to build relationships with those students who do not believe in themselves. My
                first education is a maths degree from Queen Marry University. Strong mathematical skills are the very
                foundation of my lessons.
            </p>
            <p>I love to work with teenagers because they are dynamic, impetuous and very authentic. They live through a
                time of vulnerability, fatigue and growth, and my job is to support them through this time. In my
                lessons, I create a space where they can be themselves. Letting them know that I believe in them makes
                it easier to set challenging tasks. I believe and make them believe in the reality of their achievement.
                With young children, especially with intense work, the mood and inner feelings of the child play a key
                role. When a warm, trusting relationship has been built between us, identifying errors is not perceived
                as criticism but becomes support and help in moving forward. I strive for each lesson with a young child
                to find interesting, engaging materials and games. It is an active and lively teacher who engages in the
                work best.</p>
