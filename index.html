               <p class="content">"Sullivan play`ed one of the most difficult roles in the entire Greek canon with ease. Her emotion, her inner struggle, and her pacing were all executed with unmistakable precision. She made Medea very multifaceted and complexâ€” she was sarcastic, seductive, cunning, maternal, honest, and emotional all at once...Director Tiffani Swalley and actress Emily Sullivan are absolutely two artists to watch."</p>
