# NikolTroyan


### Nikol has been an online tutor for over seven years and has realised that much of her time and energy is spent repeatedly telling people about herself and her story. She thought this time could be spent more efficiently expanding her projects and working towards her goals. She needed a website that would be a tool to tell people about herself and her vision. Working seven years in education left Nikol with various projects, which she wanted to keep in one place.

### I have expressed my wish to create a website for her that she could use. 

### The website is live and the link can be found here [Here](url(https://margaritaatr.github.io/nikoltroyan/))

# `UX`

## `Site Purpose:` 

### This website is designed to allow viewers to understand Nikol's professional values and vision regarding education. The primary purpose is to build a bridge between her brand and potential customers. 

## `Site Goal:` 

### To ensure customers get up-to-date information about the ongoing projects and can express their interest using the "get in touch" form provided. 

## `Audience: `

### The target audience for this website is anyone looking for a maths tutor, most commonly to be parents of children aged 5 to 18 years old. Those who would like to find a Maths/Physics tutor or is interested in extra curricular classes. 

## `Communication:` 

* All customer needs are considered when planning and designing the website.
* The website has a home page with a navigation bar, which helps customers quickly to find necessary information.
* Each main section ( like  about me, projects and form ) is on a separate page, making it easy for the eyes to observe.
* Customers' feedback is stated on the home page to catch the attention of the reader and to build initial trust. 
* The contact form is built to get in touch with Nikol through the website.

## `User goals:`

1. Find a maths or physics tutor for their children
2. Find out about Nicol's values and teaching strategies
3. Access her current projects at one place and find the relevant links to gather more information
4. Read customer feedback
5. Get in touch with her



## `Design:`

### The design is minimalistic; the background picture on the home page is Nikols portrait image. The chosen photo allows the eye-contact experience, usually lacking in online interactions and provides greater trust and sympathy. 
### There is one more portrait picture on "About Me" page. It is more relaxed and creates a warm atmosphere while reading about Nikol's personal story. 
<br>

## `Colour scheme:`

### The following colours have been chosen to provide the proper contrast without feeling overwhelmed.
### The website's primary colour is rich black (RGB 2,21,21), which looks good with the black & white portrait picture, white logo and navigation bar and grey colour for feedback containers. To make a bit of contrast in black in white,  I have added a gold colour for buttons on projects page.
