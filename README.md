# NikolTroyan


 Nikol has been an online tutor for over seven years and has realised that much of her time and energy is spent repeatedly telling people about herself and her story. She thought this time could be spent more efficiently expanding her projects and working towards her goals. She needed a website that would be a tool to tell people about herself and her vision. Working seven years in education left Nikol with various projects, which she wanted to keep in one place.

 I have expressed my wish to create a website for her that she could use. 

 The website is live and the link can be found here [Here](https://margaritaatr.github.io/nikoltroyan/)

# `UX`

## `Site Purpose:` 

 This website is designed to allow viewers to understand Nikol's professional values and vision regarding education. The primary purpose is to build a bridge between her brand and potential customers. 

## `Site Goal:` 

To ensure customers get up-to-date information about the ongoing projects and can express their interest using the "get in touch" form provided. 

## `Audience: `

 The target audience for this website is anyone looking for a maths tutor, most commonly to be parents of children aged 5 to 18 years old. Those who would like to find a Maths/Physics tutor or is interested in extra curricular classes. 


## `User goals:`

1. Find a maths or physics tutor for their children
2. Find out about Nicol's values and teaching strategies
3. Access her current projects at one place and find the relevant links to gather more information
4. Read customer feedback
5. Get in touch with her



# `Design:`
 
   We had two meetings with Nikol, where we discussed the website's design layout. We had a few trials of changing the project page to make everyone happy. She also asked to change a few things, like the background colour of feedback containers or icons for projects. All of Nikols needs were taken into consideration when I wrote the code. We choose a black and white minimalistic design with the background picture of Nikol on the home page.

<br>

## `Wireframes:`

![Alt text](/assets/features/wireframes.png)

After the first meeting with Nikol, where we discussed her goals, website audience and requirements, I sketched the wireframe design of the website using Balsamiq application.
The design has been slightly changed since then, but it really helped me decide on the website's layout design.


## `Colour scheme:`

![Alt text](/assets/features/colour-pallete.png)

The above colours have been chosen to provide the proper contrast without feeling overwhelmed.
The website's primary colour is rich black (RGB 2,21,21), which looks good with the black & white portrait picture, white logo and navigation bar and grey colour for feedback containers. To make a bit of contrast in black and white,  I have added a gold colour for buttons on projects page.


<br>

## `Typography:`

 Bacasime Antique has been used for entire body, accompanied by Bitter on "About Me" and and "get in touch"  section.
 The fonts used for this project are from [Google Fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/)
The icons used  for social media links and projects are from [Font Awesome.](https://fontawesome.com/)
<br>

## `Imagery:`

 Nikol has provided portrait pictures of herself. The portrait on the home page, was taken by professional photographer. This photo allows the eye-contact experience, usually lacking in online interactions and provides greater trust and sympathy. 
The picture on "About Me" page ( was taken by phone) is more relaxed and creates a warm atmosphere while reading about Nikol's personal story. 

<br>

# `Existing Features`

-  The full responsive navigation bar was built on all four pages, which contain the links to the "Home", "About" ,"Projects" and "Get in Touch" page. Each page is identical and easy to navigate.
- The navigation bar will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices.

<br>

## **`PROJECTS`**
<br>

<br>

-  The "My Projects" page includes Nikol's four projects. Each project is briefly described in an identical column  and provides links to the websites where customers can find more information about a particular project. 
- The grid layout was used for columns , which was later changed to flex layout for media queries 460px.
-  The "More" buttons were created for future pages, which are currently under development.

<br>

## **`Response page`**

![Alt text](/assets/features/response-img.png)
<br>

 Dummy "response" page has been included for the form and all links, which are under development.

<br>

## **`Future Features:`**

- The links for the websites for all projects.
- The additonal pages for "More info".
- The payment page.

<br>

## **`TESTING`**

## Manual Testing

-  I tested the website by opening it in Google Chrome and Safari browsers. All pages look good, all icons and social links work.
- I confirm that all elements that are clicable function accordingly.
- I tested the form, and it works fine - submit button works, and the email field only accepts an email address.
- All links open to external pages as required.


## Validator testing

- HTML files pass through W3C validator testing with no errors found and only one warning, which is fine, as there is no headers required as per agreed design with client.

<br>

![Alt text](/assets/features/w3c.png)

<br>

- HTML files pass through Jigsaw validator with no errors found.

![Alt text](/assets/features/jigsaw.png)

- The website pages have a great accessibility rating in Lighthouse.

![Alt text](/assets/features/light-house.png)

## **`Fixed Bugs`**

- One of the bugs was to make feedback columns responsive in the media screen less than 700px. When I would decrease a screen, the three columns would not go to one vertical line. <br>
 ![Alt text](/assets/features/odd-feedback.png)
  I tried to increase/decrease the grid-template-columns min-max criteria, but it did not work. After searching in Google, I found a solution in www.w3schools.com website to apply a flex style to the feedback container, and it made it work the way I like it.
<br>

```
.feedback-container{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
```

- Another bug, which I could not resolve for hours, was with the header. I have fixed its position with the following style to scroll up and down the screen and leave the header fixed.
<br>

```
  header{
        position:fixed;
        left: 0;
        top: 0;
        width: 100%;
    }
 ```   

<br>
However, The hamburger navigation bar disappeared, and the header cut the next section's top, making it look odd. I tried to apply padding and margins, but it would not work. After reading guides from www.w3schools.com , I found a solution to I apply "z-index:2;" and "margin-bottom - 70px" to the header.

<br>

-  When I initially ran HTML files through the W3C validator, it found a few errors, such as not closing anchors in the footer. Once added a closing tags, the issue was resolved.

- The same was with CSS validator. Initially, It has been identified that social media anchors in the footer were missing aria-labels attributes, which provides a way to place a descriptive text label for the links. It is required if the links are no-visible on the page; the text labels describe them.
Once the attributes have been added, the validator has not found any errors.

<br>

## **`Credits`**

- Initial inspiration I got from the "Love Running" and "Resume" projects.
 The code for the header, zoomed cover text and footer has been written using the styles from the "Love Running" project.
Of course, I wrote my code to suit the website's needs.

- The instructions on how to implement a hamburger navigation bar were taken from a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flItyHiDm7E&t=423s

- The code for the "get in touch" form  was written after watching a youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=524ycUqs3f0&t=736s

- To understand how "flex" and "grid" layout work for columns, I read the guides from Developer Mozilla website https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Grids
 and 
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp

- The answer to how to make the grid columns responsive I found from the following website
https://travishorn.com/responsive-grid-in-2-minutes-with-css-grid-layout-4842a41420fe


- The credits also go to my partner and Nikol( the owner of the website), who suggested me the best-looking design.

- I want to thank my mentor Martina, who gave some tips on how to write code and advised me about criteria which should be met. She also spotted few thing, which I needed to change during the mid-review meeting.
